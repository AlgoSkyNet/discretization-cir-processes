# Progress

## Meeting: 27.02.18
We must be able to:
- Generate Y
- Compute the threshold
- Implement formula (16) for values between 0 and K
- Use the code given by `cir2`

We should **focus on these tasks** due next meeting. Our aim is to finish implementing the scheme (recall we are working on the the second order version of the scheme).
It should be interesting to do some research on the _Heston model_.

Recall that using Normal would generate negative variables.
